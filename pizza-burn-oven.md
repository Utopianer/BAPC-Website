### How to Burn

1. Make sure you are on the Polygon Network on your Metamask wallet
2. Connect your wallet by pressing the button in the top right corner
3. Click the "Allow Burning" button to give the Smart Contract permission to burn your NFTs\
   (Metamask will warn you about the approval transaction, we generally recommend you use a separate wallet to approve such transactions)
4. After the first transaction confirmed, make sure the button changed from "Allow Burning" to "Burn" (sometimes you need to refresh the website)
5. Select the Pizzas you want to burn from your "Inventory"
6. Adjust the amount of each selected Pizza in the "Burn" tab
7. Click the "Burn" Button if you are ready with your selection\
   (Burning is irreversible, make sure you only burn the Pizza NFTs you want!)
8. After confirmation, click the "Add BREAD to Wallet" Button to see your $BREAD tokens in your wallet
